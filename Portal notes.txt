    Problem Definition (Developer Portal)
        https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=233413091 
        single point of information 
        too much going on
        aesthetic and minimalistic
        want to do something, not only read happy fluff
        no story to link the offerings
        make the whole experience more easy to consume
        clutter on the Homepage
        No breadcrumbs

            Develop vs Capabilities
            Not sure what Central is
            information what it does, not the marketing explanation 
            build my first app or my first API 
            everything you need to know to get started

            Where should I start? I want on opinionated starting point
            reduce the cognitive load
            microsites for each piece that's aggregated by something bigger

            Devportal and Platform  menus, language and arrangement should align
            Blogs are in the Dev  portal, community and in the menu
            Navigation is broken down to links which lead you to pages that underneath are also having navigation
            I can't do API Management without central. Central is the platform

            Tell the story in a graphical representation of where you can see how things connect
            I see diff. platform offerings but no story to link them
            Give me a synopsis of what Community portal is, what DevLink is,etc
            a solution, not individual products
        Mitko Pelov(BG)
            I usually go to a Devportal with the idea to find something specific. I don't go to research and to know more about other products.
            he is looking for search field most of the time and he would use this first
            liked the Learn section 
            some of the things like tutorials and code samples could be moved in the Devportal. The documentation for him is not the most convenience place to look at them

Guide me through this 
    House: build my first app or my first API
    Wang: Where should I start? I want on opinionated starting point
    ===> idea: a set of roadtrips

Contradictions
    Pelov: I don't go to research and to know more about other products
    Wiese: a solution, not individual products
    ===> idea: separate urls for different sections
